# Use UV Package Manager

Always use `uv` as the package manager for this project instead of other tools like pip, poetry, or pipenv.

## Why?
- UV is significantly faster than other Python package managers
- Provides consistent dependency resolution
- Better caching and parallel downloads
- Compatible with standard Python packaging tools

## Examples

### Don't use poetry
```bash
poetry add requests
```

### Don't use pip
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Don't use pipenv
```bash
pipenv install requests
```

### Do use uv to install packages
```bash
uv add requests
```
